# Matrix.RPS

"This program will simulate the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors but with the theme of the movie "The Matrix..."

This project is being completed as a part of the Udacity RMIT Intro Into Programming Nanodegree. 
The goal of this Python program was to simulate the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with human input against AI, in this case Neo(User) vs Agent Smith(AI).

Please note that you will need to import colorama to see the effect of the green forefront font lettering.(Or of course if you have just changed the entire command line interface to green will work aswell, but i added it in for matrix effect.)

I got alot of help from the course modules during this period of writing this code, also with help from other youtube videos and walkthroughs of people creating different versions of the game. This has been the most challenging but also most satisfying part of the course so far.
